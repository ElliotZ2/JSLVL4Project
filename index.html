    <p id="instructions">Welcome to the Picture Puzzle. Your task is to rearrange parts of the picture to get them into the correct order.
        Once you've clicked shuffle, the game begins. You can click on two tiles to swap them. Try to complete the game in as few swaps as possible.
        Good luck!
